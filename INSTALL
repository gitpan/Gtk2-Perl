To install Gtk2-perl, you need a few additional Perl modules; these can be
found at CPAN. The modules are:

Inline - http://search.cpan.org/author/INGY/Inline-0.44/
 (PLS apply patch in "inline_0_44.diff" distributed with gtk2-perl)

Inline::Files - http://search.cpan.org/author/DCONWAY/Inline-Files-0.60/

Parse::RecDescent - http://search.cpan.org/author/DCONWAY/Parse-RecDescent-1.80/

Each of these - and Gtk2-perl itself - are installed by unpacking them, then
running:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test - if you want to make sure it's been built OK. note
	    that due to the young age of gtk2-perl, it will be
	    fairly common that some tests fail for it :)

then, as root:

make install

or, as a user:

make install PREFIX=/wherever/you/want

this will require running the programs this way:

perl -I/wherever/you/want/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0 program_name

(adapt to your version of perl)


After having done this for each of the modules, you should be able to run most
of the included examples. Note that it's early days yet for Gtk2-perl, so don't
be surprised that there are still a lot of problems even with the included
examples.
