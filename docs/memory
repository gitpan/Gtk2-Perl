This document explains how memory management works in Gtk2-Perl,
and how to not create memory leaks in your programs.


Of course, as in C code, memory leaks are not always important,
and the safest and quickest is to ignore leaks when they are not
important to you.

Understanding this document needs a little background in gtk2, in
particular the object hierarchy (having written a simple C
program or rapidly browsing the documentation should be enough).


    [*] Gtk background

There are 3 classes of objects to distinguish:

1. the GtkObject hierarchy

2. the GObject hierarchy (that don't inherit from GtkObject as
   well, of course)

3. "boxed types"; these are structs that are not GObject (things
  such as GdkColor, GdkRectangle or GtkTextIter for example)


1. In the GtkObject hierarchy, objects that are not toplevel
   widgets are created in the "floating" state (it indicates that
   they don't have yet a parent). Then, when they become the
   child of another object (when you "pack_start" or "add" them),
   this floating state disappears. At that time, just forget
   about it: when the "top" parent will get destroyed (the
   GtkWindow), it will free up the associated memory of its whole
   child tree.

2. In the GObject hierarchy, objects use the normal refcounting
   strategy, without the "floating" state. The user thus "ref"
   and "unref" them to manipulate the reference counter. When the
   reference counter drops down to zero, Gtk will release it.

3. Boxed types are typical C structs. When we "malloc" one, we of
   course need to "free" it, when done with it.


    [*] From within Gtk2-Perl

1. the GtkObject hierarchy:

  - just call the "destroy" method on the toplevel widget; this
    will free up the memory of this widget and all of its childs;

  - if for any reason you create some non toplevel widgets you
    don't make child of another widget, you need to clean them up
    by calling "sink" on them

2. the GObject hierarchy: if you allocated a GObject, you will
   need to call "unref" on it to free it.

   Now, of course, life is not always that simple. You will
   manipulate some GObject's which are just references (for
   example Gtk2::TextView::get_buffer), and of course if you ever
   "unref" it, the actual owner of it will be unhappy when it
   will try to unref it itself (you'll see a nice gtk critical
   message on the console). However, of course, you will also
   manipulate some GObject's which are new objects owner by you
   only (for example Gtk2::Style::new).

   So the question is, did you allocate a GObject, or did you
   just obtain a reference on an existing one? The definitive
   answer can only be found in the API documentation of Gtk, but
   we try to maintain a list of those at the end of that
   documentation. Please refer to the list to know if you need to
   unref any GObject you manipulate. In any case, the only
   authoritative answer is in the gtk API documentation.

3. boxed types: if you allocated a boxed type, you will need to
   call "free" on it.

   Similarly to what happens with the GObject hierarchy,
   sometimes you will have really allocated an object (for
   example, Gtk2::Gdk::Color::new), and sometimes you will just
   manipulate a reference on an existing one
   (Gtk2::Gdk::Event::Expose::area).

   If you'd have programmed in C, you'd have malloc'ed the struct
   yourself, so you would have the answer easily. But here, the
   Gtk2 Perl extension code hides the memory allocation;
   therefore, we maintain a list of these at the end of that
   file.



    [*] The lists

Here is the list of subroutines which return back a GObject, with
the type of GObject it returns, and whether it allocates memory
or not. If that's the case, call "unref" on it once you're
finished with it, to free its associated memory.

Gtk2::Gdk::Drawable::get_colormap                  Gtk2::Gdk::Colormap              reference

Gtk2::Pango::Context::get_metrics                  Gtk2::Pango::FontMetrics         allocates (it's not a GObject, but use unref anyway)
Gtk2::Style::new                                   Gtk2::Style                      allocates

Here is the list of subroutines which return back a boxed type,
with the type of boxed type it returns, and whether it allocates
memory or not. If that's the case, call "free" on it once you're
finished with it, to free its associated memory.
