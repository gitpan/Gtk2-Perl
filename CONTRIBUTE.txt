The plan was NOT to hack together wrappers for all functions
in Gtk+ 2.x at once. Rather I want "use cases" so that all
code gets tested.

Most examples from the tutorial http://www.gtk.org/tutorial/
is porting to gtk2-perl and needed functionality is implemented
in the library. 
Missing is the creation of new widgets, but that should probably
wait until after 1.0 is released.

Anyway we can accept code and patches:
- examples (big or small) of working or not working perl/gtk+ code.
- new wrappers and function should have "use cases" == test that use that code
- patches should have a changelog entry explain the hows and whys
